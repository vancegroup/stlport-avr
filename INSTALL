**********************************************************************

STLport-4.0 now comes with SGI iostream implementation, providing
full ANSI C++ Standard library !

This distribution contains STLport sources only.
To use SGI iostreams, you have to build STLport library from sources in "src" 
directory and link your programs with it.

This is major change since pre-4.0 releases, please read the instructions carefully.

==== Unpacking and installing STLport ==========

1) Unpack STLport archive to a directory accessible during compilation.
   NOTE : DO NOT overwrite header files coming with the compiler, even if you made
   a backup - this won't work ! Most probably, you've already unpacked the archive before
   reading this file though ;)

2) Make sure "stlport" directory of this distribution comes before compiler's one 
   in your search path when you compile the project;

   Note: for SUnPro CC 5.0 and higher, there is a special directory "stlport/SC5"
         to be set in search path due to specific SUNpro search rules)/

3) Make sure you do not rename this "stlport" subdirectory -
   that may result in compilation errors.

   NOTE : Do NOT attempt to run "configure" ! It is deprecated, moved to safe standalone folder
          and should be used as a helper to create initial config for a new compiler only. 
          Your compiler should be auto-recognized.
	  Please edit appropriate configuration header for your compiler
          directly if you have to make compiler-specific configuration changes.

   IMPORTANT :
   If you DO NOT plan to use SGI iostreams implementation, please : 
   3a) uncomment __STL_NO_SGI_IOSTREAMS setting in "stlport/stl_user_config.h" to disable use
       of SGI iostreams and to use wrappers around your existing iostreams. 
       After disabling SGI iostreams, you will use wrappers around  your compiler's iostreams 
       libabry, as in previous STLport releases.
       No binary library for STLport needs to be built in this case.
       Note though :
        - new-style ANSI iostreams may not be available on your system;
        - compiler's iostreams are most likely slower than SGI version.
  If you decide to disable SGI iostreams, you may stop reading here.


==== Building STLport (SGI iostreams) library ==========

Below are step-by-step instructions to build STLport library:

4)  Go to "src" subdirectory. It contains various makefiles for different 
    compilers.  If you are not able to find makefile for your particular 
    compiler, please use one that looks most similar to your make engine to 
    create your own.

    Verify you can do command line compiles. IDE users may have to do something 
    special, like add environment variables (for Microsoft) or install 
    additional compiler components (for Metrowerks), before they can use their 
    command line compilers.

5)  Using appropriate makefile, do "make clean all" to build the STLport libraries
    (makefiles are set up to build several different flavors - debug/nondebug,
    static/dynamic versions).
    Optionally, do "make install" to copy STLport headers and libraries to shared location.

    Note : your "make" program may have different name, like "nmake" for Visual C++.

    Examples : 
     1. If you are building STLport for just one compiler, you may do something like that
        (DOS syntax for Visual C++ below):
        copy vc6.mak makefile
        nmake clean all
        nmake install

     2. If you plan to build STLport with multiple compilers, use "make -f" :
	make -f gcc.mak clean install
	make -f sunpro.mak clean install

        This will build and install STLport for gcc & SUN CC.

        "install" target works on most platforms.

         On Win32, it does the following :
          - copies STLport headers in "stlport" subdirectory of your compiler's INCLUDE directory;
          - copies STLport .lib files in your compiler's LIB directory;
          - copies STLport DLLs to Windows system directory so they can be found at runtime.

	 On UNIX, it does the following :
          - copies STLport headers in "stlport" subdirectory of system's local include directory (default is /usr/local/include);
          - copies STLport .a and .so files to system local library directory (default is /usr/local/lib);

6)  If build fails, you may choose to :
     - try fixing the build ;
     - wait until somebody else will submit corresponding changes to be incorporated in next STLport 
       release/snapshot. To use STLport w/o SGI iostreams, please do step 3a).

    In case you do fix STLport, please submit your patches to fbp@stlport.org or (better)
    to STLport Forum (http://www.stlport.org/forum)

7) Do "make install" to install resulting libraries into "./lib" subdirectory.
 
==== Linking your application with STLport library ==========

8) Supply the "lib" subdirectory to the library search path and add desired 
   library to the list of libraries to link with.
   Examples (imagine you have mytest.cpp in the same directory as this file is):
	With gcc     : gcc -I./stlport mytest.cpp -L./lib/ -lstlport_gcc
	With DEC CC  : cxx -I./stlport mytest.cpp -L./lib/ -lstlport_deccxx
	With SUN CC  : CC -I./stlport/SC5 mytest.cpp -L./lib/ -lstlport_sunpro
	.....
   [ Visual C++ specific ] For VC++, you do not have to specify "stlport-msvc-XXX.lib" explicitly,
   as it is being choosen and forced to link automatically by "#pragma"'s in stlport/config/stl_select_lib.h.
   Appropriate version is being selected based on /MD[d] vs /MT[d] options and __STL_DEBUG setting.
   All you have to do is to set library search path for the linker.
	Example :
           cl.exe /I.\stlport mytest.cpp /link /libpath:.\lib /MD

9) If you linked your application with shared STLport library (.so or .dll), please make your .so or
   .dll's to be found in PATH at runtime. On Windows, the simplest way to do it
   is to copy all .dll's to Windows system directory. Or, you might choose to add directory
   containing STLport to the PATH environment string. 

10) Have fun !
